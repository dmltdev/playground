/*
1768. Merge Strings Alternatively

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
Example 3:

Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d

const mergeAlternately = function(word1, word2) {

    // let maxLength =[word1.length, word2.length].sort((a,b) => b - a)[0];
    let maxLength = Math.max(word1.length, word2.length);
    for (let i = 0; i < maxLength; i++) {
        res += word1.slice(i, i+1);
        res += word2.slice(i, i+1)
    }
    return res;
};

console.log(mergeAlternately('ab', 'pqrs'));
