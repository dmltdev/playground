https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-cancellation/description/

Given a function fn, an array of arguments args, and an interval time t, return a cancel function cancelFn. 
The function fn should be called with args immediately and then called again every t milliseconds until cancelFn is called.

const cancellable = function(fn, args, t) {
    fn(...args)
    let timer = setInterval(() => fn(...args), t)
    let cancelFn = () => clearInterval(timer);
    return cancelFn;
};
